# Algorithm Assignments
This repo contains assignments for algorithm class when I was a sophomore in NDHU.  
There are total 6 assignments in this repo, A1 to A7 not including A5.  
  
The discription of the problems are as follows:
* A1: Algorithms and complexity
    * Design an algorithm to find all palindromes of length greater or equal to 2. It does not need to be an optimal algorithm, as long as it can solve the problem.  
    * Analyze the every-case (if exists), worst-case, average-case, and best-case time complexities of your algorithm.  
    * Textbook exercises 1-15~18, 1-22.
* A2: Divide and conquer
    * A2-1: 
        * Design and implement the improved and D&C version of the maximum subarray sum algorithm.
    * A2-2: 
        * The Closest Pair of Points problem is to find the closest pair of points in a set of points in x-y plane. Design and implement a D&C algorithm to solve the problem.
    * Textbook exercises: 2.6, 2.7, 2.13.
* A3: Dynamic Programming
    * A3-1:
        * Assume that we want to develop a shopping APP in which a consumer can provide a wish list of items with preferences in the range of 1~100. Then given the current market prices of all items and a budget cap, find a set of items that maximize the sum of preferences with total spending under(≤) the budget cap.
        * Explain why the problem is (or not) good for DP.
        * Design and implement an algorithm for the problem.
        * Analyze the complexity of your algorithm.
    * A3-2: 
        * Assume that you are in the Department of Tourism of the Hualien County. You are to divide the n miles Isozaki Coast (磯崎海灘) into segments of length i miles, 1≤i ≤n, with different prices (pre-determined by the Taiwan government) for renting to the travel vendors. Design and implement an algorithm to find the optimal way of dividing the coast to maximize profit(sum of prices). Do the same as problem 1.
    * Textbook exercises: 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-13.
* A4: Greedy Algorithm
    * A4-1:
        * Assume that there are n cars and n parking lots initially aligned along a straight road on specific locations. A car can stay at its location, move from x to x+1, or move from x to x-1. Each move takes 1 minute. Assign cars to parking lots so that the sum of time to move all cars to lots is minimized. (Can only move one car at a time.)
        * Design a greedy algorithm to solve the problem.
        * Prove the optimality of your algorithm.
        * Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.
        * Write a program and test it properly.
    * A4-2: 
        * Given a set of n keywords S = {k1, k2, …, kn} where no word is a part of another word. Find a sentence string T such that for all ki belongs to S such that ki belongs to T and |T| (i.e. the length of T) is minimized.
        * Design a greedy or DP algorithm to solve the problem.
        * If it is greedy, show if it is also an optimal one or not.
        * Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.
        * Write a program and test it properly.
* A6: Backtracking & Branch-and-bound
    * Textbook exercises: 5-1, 5-7, 6-7.
* A7: Maximum flow
    * Two problems given by professor.

Note that the file that contains textbook problems will be named as "textbook_Ax" as word or pdf file.  
The others are cpp or pdf file named "Ax", there are codes and the answer of the question the professor gave.  
There are also some test cases in the "text cases" file in some "410821305_Ax" file.
